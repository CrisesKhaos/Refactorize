          Randomize(); has always tried its best to encourage coding culture by
          hosting meaningful and brainstorming events for the brightest minds of
          our community. We are thrilled to announce the opening of
          "REFACTORIZE();", our own annual techfest where we give everyone a
          chance to learn and execute, even if you are a newbie. Get ready
          because your brain is getting a gym membership for 3 days! It might
          get tiring, but it'll all be worth it!
          <br />6 Events, Lot's of CODING and LEARNING. Hackathon, Panel talk,
          workshop, ideathon, Cryptic hunt, and of course the Trivia night!
